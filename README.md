### dev

![Dev Build](https://github.com/nordeck/fosdem-schedule-element-widget/workflows/Docker%20Image%20Build/badge.svg?branch=dev)

## Prerequisites

The project requires [node >=12.13.0](https://nodejs.org) and uses [Yarn 1.22.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) instead of npm.<br />
To check if you have the required versions installed you can run:

```sh
node --version && yarn --version
```

## Installation

**Do NOT use `npm install` to install packages!**<br />
To install all dependencies you can just run:

```sh
yarn
```

To add new dependencies to the project use:

```sh
yarn add [package-name] --dev
```

## Development

### Local Testing

To test the widget locally you can add it to a room using `/addwidget https://localhost:3000?theme=$theme&room=M.misc`. This will only work in either:

- a Chrome instance that is started with `--allow-insecure-localhost --disable-site-isolation-trials --disable-web-security` flags (seems broken as at 2023); or
- a Firefox-based browser instance with the [CORS Everywhere] extension set to the 'green' mode.
  - To create a new development profile for installing this extension, start Firefox with `firefox -p` and choose the option to create a new profile. Give it a clear name so that the profile is not accidentally used for web browsing! (You can also start with `firefox -p profilename`.)

> WARNING: Do not use this Chrome instance — or the Firefox CORS Everywhere extension — to browse the web! CORS is a security feature and disabling it would allow websites to impersonate you on other websites.
